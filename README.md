# AI Recruitment & Fraud Detection System

## üìå Overview
This project is an **AI-powered recruitment and fraud detection system** designed to streamline hiring processes and ensure authenticity.  
It includes modules for **job‚Äìresume semantic matching, AI-driven interview evaluation, fraud detection (face verification & focus monitoring), and candidate scoring** across multiple dimensions (technical, communication, culture fit).  

## üöÄ Features
- **Semantic Job‚ÄìResume Matching**  
  - NLP-based similarity scoring between job descriptions and resumes.  
  - Uses embeddings (BERT/SentenceTransformers).  

- **AI Interview Module**  
  - Automatic **Q&A generation** from job descriptions.  
  - **Answer evaluation** using NLP and scoring metrics.  

- **Fraud Detection Prototype**  
  - **Face verification** during video interviews.  
  - **Focus monitoring** to detect tab-switching or distraction.  

- **Candidate Scoring Engine**  
  - Technical Fit (skills match).  
  - Communication Fit (clarity, grammar, structure).  
  - Culture Fit (soft skills, sentiment).  

- **Backend Ready**  
  - Models are **containerized** and **API-ready** for integration into systems.
